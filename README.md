# Discovering Evolutionary Ancestors in Ion Channel Superfamily Proteins: Biomedical AI

**Duration:** December 2023 - February 2024

## Project Overview

- Built an end-to-end ML model to discover a correlation between protein (AA Sequences) structure and their functions.
- Constructed a 5-layer neural network to distinguish between positive and negative classifiers amongst prokaryotic cells.
- Developed word embeddings for two-pore ion channels; achieved a test accuracy of 92.15% and F1-score of 0.81.
